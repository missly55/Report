# Vulnerability Scanning Project

## Overview:
In this project, I set up an isolated environment using **VirtualBox** to perform vulnerability scanning. The tools used for this project were:
- **Nmap**: Network scanner used for identifying hosts and services.
- **Wireshark**: Network protocol analyzer used to capture and analyze network traffic.
- **Nessus**: Vulnerability scanning tool used to detect potential security risks.

## Tools:
- **Ubuntu** as the host machine.
- **VirtualBox** for creating isolated virtual environments.
- **Nmap** for network scanning.
- **Wireshark** for packet capturing and analyzing network traffic.
- **Nessus** for scanning vulnerabilities.

## Step 1: Set Up a Virtualized Environment

- Creating a virtualized environment using VirtualBox and Ubuntu to perform a vulnerability assessments.

Download and Install VirtualBox:

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Machine:
- Download Ubuntu:
Go to the Ubuntu download page and download the latest Ubuntu Desktop ISO.

## Step 3: Install Nmap, Nessus, and Wireshark

- Once you have Ubuntu installed and running on your virtual machine, you can install the tools needed for vulnerability assessments: Nmap, Nessus, and Wireshark.
- Install Nmap
- Open Terminal in Ubuntu and run the following command to install Nmap:
- sudo apt update 
- sudo apt install nmap

- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install wireshark

 **Nessus Installation Issues**
During installation of **Nessus** within Ubuntu, I ran into connection issues that prevented proper setup in the virtual environment. I solved this by researching online and found a helpful video tutorial:
